# Contributing to Kitsu

Hi there! If you're reading this, then you've probably decided to help
write code for this project.

If you are, then I would like to ask that you follow these guidelines
while writing code:

1. **Make sure it's actually needed**. As this is a _third-party client_,
we can't actually create new features that aren't supported by the backend.
While that super-cool idea you might have seem great, it's sometimes too
niche for us.

2. **Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. If you are not
kind to everyone in our community, we don't want anything to do with you.
Even if you write code using the nosehairs of the gods, we still won't
accept it.

That's it!

I hope you enjoy working with us. If you have any problems, please email
me at [her@mint.lgbt](mailto:her@mint.lgbt) with details, and I'll do my
best to help.
